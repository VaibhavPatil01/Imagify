## Project Overview

Imagify is an AI-powered application that generates images from text inputs. Users can create an account, log in, and generate images using credits, which can be purchased through the integrated payment gateway. The generated images are powered by the **Clipdrop API**, which provides advanced image generation capabilities.

### Key Features:
- **Text to Image Generation**: Users can input a text prompt, and the app will generate an image using **Clipdrop API**.
- **Credit System**: Users receive credits upon sign-up and can purchase additional credits to generate more images.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using **MongoDB** and **Express** for handling user details.
- **Payment Integration**: Secure payment system integrated to purchase credits using **Razorpay** or other payment gateways.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - **React.js** (for building the user interface)
  - **Axios** (for API calls)
  - **React Router** (for navigation)
